# fastport
This is a simple binary I wrote to automate a nmap in a robust efficient way. 

## Installation

All one must do is download and put the binary into there bin folder of choice. \n
example : "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WanderingBytes/fastport/main/fastport -o /bin" (or the bin folder of choice, just make sure it is in your path variable)
